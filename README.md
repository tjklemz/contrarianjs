# Contrarian JS

Unpopular opinions on front-end engineering. This book will challenge the way you think about JavaScript. Prepare for some cognitive dissonance but also a breath of fresh air in an industry unnecessarily inundated with frameworks and libraries.

This is for people who miss solving problems, who miss designing code, who tire of bandwagon engineering.

Welcome.

Each chapter will be published on the web at [ContrarianJS](https://contrarianjs.com). Eventually, this will be a complete book. You can sign up for the mailing list at the aforementioned website to keep up-to-date and be the first to read each chapter.

I hope you enjoy it.

Special thanks to the [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com) website for getting me thinking all those months ago. And special thanks as well to [Aurifex Labs](https://github.com/aurifexlabs) for some great conversations about this.
