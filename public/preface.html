<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>Unpopular opinions on front-end engineering. This book will challenge the way you think about JavaScript. Prepare for some cognitive dissonance but also a breath of fresh air in an industry unnecessarily inundated with frameworks and libraries.</p>

<p>This is for people who miss solving problems, who miss designing code, who tire of bandwagon engineering.</p>

<p>Welcome.</p>

<p>Each chapter will be published on the web at [ContrarianJS](https://contrarianjs.com). Eventually, this will be a complete book. You can sign up for the mailing list at the aforementioned website to keep up-to-date and be the first to read each chapter.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Special thanks to the <a href="http://vanilla-js.com">Vanilla JS</a> website for getting me thinking all those months ago. And special thanks as well to <a href="https://github.com/aurifexlabs">Aurifex Labs</a> for some great conversations about this.</p>
