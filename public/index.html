	<h2>Preface</h2>

	<p>This book will challenge the way you think about JavaScript. Prepare for some cognitive dissonance but also a breath of fresh air in an industry unnecessarily inundated with frameworks and libraries.</p>

	<p>This is for people who miss solving problems, who miss designing code, who tire of bandwagon engineering.</p>

	<p>Welcome.</p>

	<p>Each chapter will be published on the web, here, at <a href="https://contrarianjs.com">Contrarian JS</a>. Eventually, this will be a complete book. You can sign up for the mailing list at the aforementioned website to keep up-to-date and be the first to read each chapter.</p>

	<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

	<p>Special thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="http://vanilla-js.com">Vanilla JS</a> website for getting me thinking all those months ago. And special thanks as well to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aurifexlabs">Aurifex Labs</a> for some great conversations about this.</p>
